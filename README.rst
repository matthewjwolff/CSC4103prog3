CSC 4103 Project 3
==================

Chosen assignments

2. A foolproof progress bar.

   (``bar.c``, ``bar.h``) This file includes no main method. The provided Makefile will create an object file, not an executable. I attempted to follow C convention and include a header file that defines the bar function. Does it make sense?

3. A port scanner.

   (``scan.c``)

4. Approximating pi.

   (``pi.c``)

5. Calculating the dot product.

   (``dot.c``)

A Makefile is included for easy compiling. ``make all``
